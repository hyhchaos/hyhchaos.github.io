I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at East China Normal University (ECNU), Shanghai, China (2017-present), and supervised by Prof. [Geguang Pu](https://facultyold.ecnu.edu.cn/s/1018/t/11459/main.jspy) and A.P. [Weikai Miao](https://facultyold.ecnu.edu.cn/s/2712/t/29229/main.jspy). I also received my B.S. degree from ECNU (2013-2017). I had a memorable visit in Cyber Security Lab (CSL), [NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx), Singapore, advised by Prof. [Yang Liu](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/yangliu/index.html) and Ph.D [Felix Juefei Xu](http://xujuefei.com/) from Alibaba (2019.9-2020.2).

My research interests are in:
- Machine Learning
- Computer Vision
- Security
